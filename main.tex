\begin{abstract}
The multitasking mechanism between activities and fragments plays a fundamental role in the Android operating system, which involves a wide range of features, including launch modes, intent flags, task affinities, and structured activities containing fragments. All of them are being widely used in Android apps, both open-source and commercial ones. In this paper, we present a formal semantics of the Android multitasking mechanism  between activities and fragments, which accommodates all the important features and gives insofar the most comprehensive and accurate formalization. In particular, our semantics is formulated based on multi-stack systems, and fully captures the behavior of task stacks and activity stacks regarding fragments. Based on the semantics, we provide new static analysis algorithms, which are both multi-stack-aware and fragment-sensitive, thus achieve more precise static analysis for Android apps. We validate our approach by extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial Android apps. The results highlight the benefits of the considering the semantics of the multitasking mechanism between activities and fragments in static analysis, and confirm the efficacy of our approach.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we have formalized the semantics of the Android multitasking mechanism by a new model {\AMASS}, which have been validated against the actual behaviors of Android systems. Based on the semantics, we provide new static analysis algorithms for detecting potential task unboundedness and fragment container unboundedness vulnerabilities. We have implemented a static analysis tool TaskDroid. The experiments show that TaskDroid is able to discover the task-unboundedness and fragment-container-unboundedness vulnerabilities for many open-source and commercial Android apps, which can be exploited to produce abnormal behaviors, e.g. black screen, app crash or even device reboot. 

The formal semantics of the {\AMASS} model defined in this paper is valuable for both the developers of Android apps and the researchers on the analysis and testing of Android apps. 
\begin{itemize}
\item the developers can read the concise and precise semantics of the {\AMASS} model, instead of the source code of the Android OS, to understand the Android activity-fragment multitasking mechanism. % in a much faster and easier way. 
%
\item Compared to the various models (e.g. activity transition graphs) in literature,  the {\AMASS} model provides refined modeling of the Android activity-fragment multitasking mechanism, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of the analysis and testing of Android apps. 
%
\item The task unboundedness issue identified in this paper is a novel type of security threats for Android apps, contributing to %and provides a different angle for developers to understand the 
the understanding the security aspect of Android UI design. 
\end{itemize}

%From our formal semantics of the Android multitasking mechanism, app developers can gain a clear understanding of how task affinities, launch modes, intent flags, and fragment transactions influence the behaviors of the back stack,facilitating better app development. This is particularly valuable as the official documentation is complex and challenging to comprehend. Furthermore, researchers can also utilize the AMASS model to propose more advanced static analysis algorithms for complex security issues related to the Android multitasking mechanism.

For the future work, more problems in static analysis %are worth studying which 
can benefit from the formalized multi-tasking semantics. 
Moreover, we believe that {\AMASS} is a fundamental model in Android UI research which deserves a thorough theoretical investigation.
